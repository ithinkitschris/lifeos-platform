locked: true

architecture:
  model: two-tier
  description: |
    LifeOS operates through a two-tier device architecture: Information Interfaces
    handle orchestration and primary interaction, while Peripheral Interfaces provide
    sensing and ambient output. Peripheral devices never orchestrate.

  principle: |
    Each device occupies a specific role in the attention spectrum. Information
    interfaces handle Center-layer content (immersive, authoritative). Peripheral
    interfaces handle Periphery-layer awareness (ambient, non-interrupting).

information_interfaces:
  description: Devices that handle orchestration and primary user interaction
  devices:
    - id: foldable-tablet
      name: Foldable Tablet
      role: Core Information Interface
      characteristics:
        - Immersive
        - Authoritative
        - Persistent
      capabilities:
        - Supports attention-heavy tasks (full workflows)
        - Primary orchestration device
        - Real-time state detection
        - Primary interaction surface
      attention_layers:
        - Center (full display)
        - Periphery (glanceable sections)
      ui_modality: Visual + Touch
      notes: |
        The foldable form factor provides both portable and extended workspace modes.
        When folded, operates as standard phone. When unfolded, provides tablet-scale
        immersive interface for attention-heavy work.

peripheral_interfaces:
  description: Devices that provide sensing and ambient output without orchestration
  principle: Peripheral devices sense and output; they never orchestrate
  devices:

      notes: |
        The "neural" designation refers to advanced biometric sensing capabilities
        that capture physiological state for mode confidence signals. The watch serves
        as the primary sensing hub for the LifeOS ecosystem.

    - id: glass
      name: Glass
      role: Core Contextual Interface

        - Non-interrupting ambient display
      capabilities:
        sensing:
          - name: Multimodal Perception Cues
            description: Synthesized environmental awareness
            signals:
              - Visual context (scene understanding, object recognition)
              - Auditory gestures (ambient sound awareness)
              - Haptic confirmation (interaction feedback)
        output:
          - name: Location-Aware AR

            features:
              - Environmental overlays (place information, navigation cues)
              - Micro-alerts that dissolve into periphery
              - Facial recognition (for contact identification)
          - name: Embedded Knowledge

      notes: |
        Glass provides ambient information augmentation without demanding attention.
        Overlays appear contextually and dissolve into periphery when not relevant.
        The device never shows Center-layer content - that requires primary interface.

    - id: earphones
      name: Earphones
      role: Secondary Interface
      ui_modality: Audio UI
      interaction_model: Secondary Conversational Perception
      characteristics:
        - Audio-based awareness
        - Voice interaction support

      capabilities:
        sensing:
          - name: Ambient Interceptions
            description: Environmental audio awareness
            features:

              - Voice commands
              - Natural language input
              - Ambient conversation detection

            description: Audio-based assistance
            features:
              - Whispered summaries (discrete information delivery)
              - Bias alerts (decision-making support)
              - Fragmented sound reproduction (attention-aware audio)
          - name: Audio Notifications
            description: Non-visual awareness
            features:
              - Subtle audio cues
              - Voice-based alerts
              - Contextual sound adjustment
      attention_layers:
        - Periphery (subtle audio cues)
        - Silence (no audio)
      coupling: Ultra-loose
      notes: |
        "Ultra-loose" coupling means earphones have the least orchestration dependency.
        They can operate semi-independently for audio playback while still respecting
        mode-based attention triage for notifications and interruptions.

attention_layer_mapping:
  description: How attention layers map to peripheral device display
  rules:
    - layer: Center
      peripheral_display: Not shown on peripherals (requires primary device)
      rationale: Center content requires immersive attention - tablet/phone only
    - layer: Periphery
      peripheral_display: Indicated on watch/glasses (counts, presence, ambient)
      rationale: Peripheral devices show awareness without demanding attention
    - layer: Silence
      peripheral_display: No indication on any device
      rationale: Silenced content remains invisible until contextually appropriate

device_interaction_principles:
  - id: no-peripheral-orchestration
    name: No Peripheral Orchestration
    description: Peripheral devices never make mode decisions or orchestrate system state
    rationale: |
      Orchestration requires full context synthesis and constitutional rule application.
      Only information interfaces have sufficient compute and context to orchestrate safely.

  - id: sensing-distribution
    name: Distributed Sensing
    description: Multiple devices contribute different signal types for mode confidence
    rationale: |
      Mode confidence requires multi-modal signal fusion. Watch provides biometric context,
      glass provides environmental awareness, earphones provide ambient audio, tablet
      provides interaction patterns.

  - id: output-appropriateness
    name: Output Appropriateness
    description: Information is delivered through the most contextually appropriate device
    rationale: |
      Haptic for non-interrupting awareness (watch), ambient visual for environmental
      context (glass), audio for hands-free scenarios (earphones), immersive for
      attention-heavy work (tablet).

  - id: graceful-degradation
    name: Graceful Degradation
    description: LifeOS functions with any subset of devices; full ecosystem is optimal but not required
    rationale: |
      User may not always wear all devices. System adapts mode confidence thresholds
      based on available signal sources. Reduced sensing → higher confirmation thresholds.

plausibility_notes:
  year: 2030
  assumptions:
    - Foldable displays have matured (price, durability, software)
    - AR glasses have achieved acceptable form factor (weight, battery, social acceptance)
    - Biometric sensing has advanced (non-invasive neural state indicators)
    - Multi-device orchestration protocols are standardized
    - Battery technology supports all-day wear for peripheral devices
  constraints:
    - No brain-computer interfaces (too speculative for 2030)
    - No implantables (social/ethical barriers)
    - No magic - all capabilities grounded in emerging tech
